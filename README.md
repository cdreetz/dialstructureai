## Dial Structure AI

This is the complete web application for DialStructureAI, an open source project for processing audio files, in particular call center style audio.  With everything built in you can easily get annotated transcriptions, sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and summarization results on all of your audio data.

If you would like to deploy the interface locally, you can start by copying this repo and running a development server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cdreetz/dialstructureai.git
```

```bash
cd dialstructureai
```

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
